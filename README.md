# Organizational Trust Index (OTI) 🧭(UI Interface on Github)

**Detecting Hidden Trust Erosion in Distributed Teams**

---

## 🚀 Overview

Organizational Trust Index (OTI) is an AI-powered, privacy-conscious HR analytics dashboard designed to **detect early signs of trust erosion** in remote and hybrid teams. It provides real-time behavioral and emotional insights to help HR leaders and managers maintain healthy, collaborative, and resilient work environments.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In distributed work settings, trust deteriorates silently. Teams become siloed, communication falters, and engagement drops — but traditional HR tools fail to detect the early behavioral signals of this erosion. Without timely intervention, this leads to:

- Increased attrition and disengagement
- Fragmented collaboration and performance bottlenecks
- Delayed crisis management by HR and leadership

---

## 💡 Solution

OTI monitors behavioral, emotional, and network-level signals (ethically and anonymously) to provide **real-time trust analytics**, allowing leadership to intervene **proactively** rather than reactively.

### Core Modules:

- **Trust Pulse Engine** – Analyzes metadata like meeting cadence and response behavior (not message content).
- **Sentiment Drift Monitor** – Uses NLP on opt-in text sources to detect tone shifts that indicate misalignment or disengagement.
- **Engagement Friction Mapper** – Identifies silos and collaboration drop-offs using network insights.
- **Trust Risk Alerts** – Prioritizes risks and recommends actionable interventions for HR.
- **Privacy & Consent Layer** – Includes opt-in analytics and customizable data retention settings.
